# Advent of Code 2022

In here you'll find my **really bad** solutions to the AoC2022 puzzles. My challenge to myself is to solve all the puzzles this year. Previous years I just managed to get around to it just a few times before life interrupted my efforts.

As I said, my solutions will by no means be elegant or fancy. I'm trying to do this in the morning before I start with work but don't even always manage that. So it will have to be quick and dirty - probably more like brute force. I might come back to puzzles in time to see if I can improve on them.
